Thank you for opening the Greetings project
========================================================
This project is a folder for all the deliverables provided during the Moday Deliverable at Sparta
When you open the greetings folder, you will see a project that takes in an integer between 1 and 24 then
returns a greeting depending on the time of day.

The value of this exercise was to show how to use control-flows and exercise my ability to use conditional statements.
